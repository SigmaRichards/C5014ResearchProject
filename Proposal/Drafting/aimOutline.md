#Aim - Outline

##Important Points from EJ
 - Primarily focus on feature selection
 - Data is 3D surface plots, should have clear purpose wrt that data
 - Clustering techniques should be used AFTER the feature selection
 - ACO feature selections (or even the full clustering process) sounds interesting
 - Data is mining pit face data

##Important Points from Ben
 - AutoEncoder: Feature selection from CNNs without the need for labelled Data
 - Seeding and Flooding techniques - possibly with relation to ACO
 - Distance metric over the manifold

## Aim Outline
 - Compare method's of feature selection for use in texture segmentation
 - Kiechle Method of feature selection - cite Kiechle_Method.pdf
 - Application or implementation of 3D data?
    - Flattening the image
    - Treat height data as color depth
      - possibly include derivatives
    - Consider distorted versions of the image
      - Coordinate conversion
