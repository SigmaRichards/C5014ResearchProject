The last clustering algorithm we'll look at is DBSCAN. This algorithm takes a different appraoch to the other 2 as it considers the density of points within regions and will sometimes not assign observations to a cluster. The algorithm is as follows.

1. Find all points within epsilon size neighbourhood of every observation.
2. Identify which points are core points by whether they have at least minPts neighbours.
3. Find which core points are connected to other core points and put them into their own cluster.
4. Assign each non-core point to a cluster if the cluster is within epsilon of a core point, otherwise assign it to noise.

The algorithm works well for arbitrarily shaped clusters and is robust to noise making it a well performing algorithm [Kurumalla, K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR BASED DBSCAN] however is very dependent on good hyperparameter selection.

Wang et al [An Improved DBSCAN Method] proposed a method for automatic epsilon estimation which achieved better segmentation accuracy than methods that used different values of epsilon.
