# Texture Analysis
## Defintion
- Texture refers to the shape, colour or general uniformity of a particular image or region
- Texture analysis looks at characterizing certain features of textures
- Field of computer vision - generally concerned with imagery

## Problems
- Object recognition
    - concerning the recognition of objects with images or the presence/absence
- pattern recognition
    - more generalised characterization, finding patterns or regularities in data
- medical image analysis
    - Specific use cases, specialised medical imaging

### Project relation
- Distinguish non-inform regions from imagery

## Goals
- Shape Extraction
    - objective to extract 3d images
- Synthesis
    - imitate, create or modify textures
- Classification
    - Providing descriptors for categorzing textural images
    - Assigning image into predefined texture classes
- Segmentation
    - Distinguish areas of an image for differing texture.
    - Similar to classification however not necessarily predefined texture classes
    - interest is with the boundaries between texture
