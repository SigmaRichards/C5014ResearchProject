Introduction

Many methods used for segmentation
Many areas to focus on with different goals
Project will focus on data specific approach
Will look at public data for reproducibility
Many techniques focus on feature extraction then clustering
Many other techniques use CNNs
Will also look at other more generalised models
Many metrics give serve different purposes
