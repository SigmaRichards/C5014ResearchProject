# Segmentation
## Problems
- Segmentation is concerned with specifying regions of differing textures
- May be the boundaries between objects, or maybe regions in the same objects
- Not necessarily classification of the different textures, just qualification that they are different
- Examples

## Project relation
- We want to segment data - detrital from bedded
- We want to focus on this specific data
- Techniques will be specific to data

## Methods
- Threshold
    - Considering values for pixels and picking some threshold to separate upon
    - Fast, simple and can be used on colour images
    - Examples, use cases and problems
- Region
    - Pixels are grouped together into larger regions, based on similarity
    - Criteria for similarity
    - Examples, use cases and problems
- Model based
    - Involve active contour models and level set methods
    - Process of evolving curves to best segment objects from their background
    - Examples, use cases and problems
